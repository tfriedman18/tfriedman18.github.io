          <p class="lead">For my lamp project, I decided to design it in a very simplistic way. I wanted to create a smaller more basic lamp. I was inspired by a lamp that I saw that was made of all rocks and I wanted to create something similar. I decided to create a lamp that is made of wood, plexiglass, beachglass and metal. This lamp is unique because I dont think I have ever seen one like it. Throughout this project I was became more comfortable using the different saws, drills and sanders. I have used most of these before but didnt have much practice and wasnt very comfortable with them. Now I feel way more comfortable using these tools. I learned how to work with medal and weld. One challege that I encountered is that the one period is not enough time to work on a project like this because once you get started and have to take turns using the different machines you have to clean up and get ready for your next class so that you arent late. Another challege that I faced was was getting the legs of my lamp screwed together and the legs even. FOr some reason after measuring and cutting the legs they ended up being uneven so i had to go back and sand then down to make them even. Another challege I faced was screwing the legs to the base of my lamp. This was difficult because it was difficult to make sure the legs were screwed in correctly and evenly so I had to redo this a couple times.   </p>
