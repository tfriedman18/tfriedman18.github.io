   This year for field academy I traveled to Laos and Cambodia with 14 other students. We were learning about meditation and the different cultures. We visited different temples, meditated with monks, visited Angkor Wat which is one of the 7 wonders of the world and visited many night markets. I found it really interesting how much trash was all over the place and how the communities and people seemed to be so far behind us with certain means of technology. We also learned a lot about the bombings in Laos and Cambodia and their impacts.  </p>
